Introduction
==============

Hello, Welcome.

In this blob of text I will be documenting my study of analog filters, one of the most useful skills in an embedded developer's arsenal. Here we will equip with the necessary knowledge to go about building filters yourselves. As a guide I'll be using the freely available copy-left texts from `here`_.

Prerequisites is some high school mathematics, which includes calculus and complex numbers. Both Matlab and ngSpice simulator is used throughout.

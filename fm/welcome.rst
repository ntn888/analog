Introduction
==============

Hello, Welcome.

In this blob of text I will be documenting my study of analog filters, one of the most useful skills in an embedded developer's arsenal. As a guide I'll be using the freely available copy-left texts from `here`_.

Prerequisites is some high school mathematics, which includes calculus and complex numbers. Both Matlab and ngSpice simulator is used throughout.
